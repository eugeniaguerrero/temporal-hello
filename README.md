## Temporal with interfaces

This is based off the [Temporal Hello World](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/go/hello_world_in_go/) example, but using interfaces instead of mocking libraries. 

### To run
Ensure you are set up [locally](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/go/dev_environment/) with Temporal. 

In a terminal window, run `go run worker/main.go`

In another window, run `go run start/main.go`
